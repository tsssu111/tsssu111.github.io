# this is a website

this repository contains the files for my personal website.

it is a static site.
no backend.
no framework.
just files.

## what’s here

* `index.html` — the main page
* `style.css` — how it looks (sometimes intentionally wrong)
* `music/` — songs, sounds, and audio files

## how it works

open the site in a browser.
click things.
sounds play.
text exists.

nothing is generated.
nothing is tracked.
nothing is optimized beyond what felt correct.

## licensing

this repository has **no license**.
all rights reserved unless stated otherwise.

## notes

* audio may not autoplay on mobile
* layout may change without warning
* this site is not finished, even when it is

that’s it.
